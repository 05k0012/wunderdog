It is with my heartfelt thanks that I would like to acknowledge Wunderdog being
named Madison Magazine's Best Of Madison Silver Award Winner for 2016!

Being that Wunderdog has been doing business in the area for a short 2.5 years,
we consider this quite the accomplishment!

We would like to thank all those who have made this appointment possible,
including Madison Magazine for their terrific contest where the public votes,
and those votes MATTER.

Our clients are the best of the best. Their confidence and appreciation for
what we do, along with their dedication/diligence in helping their dogs to be
WUNDERDOGS, astound me every single day. The differences I see in the dogs I
train are a testament to their owners, and I am so proud to be a part of that.
My clients are GOLD winners, in my opinion!

We can't wait to continue our success with this meaningful business over the
next year. TRAIN ON!
